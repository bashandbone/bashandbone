# Hi, I'm Adam.

I'm an avid pythonista who sometimes finds himself writing Rust, Typescript or Go. I don't work in tech and don't develop professionally, but I aim to write professional code. If my code does meet that standard, tell me; Since I don't work in tech, I can sometimes overlook the obvious approach. On the plus side, I occasionally stumble into novel approaches too. 

My work here is just an extension of my obsessive need to solve interesting problems and go way (**way**) too deep in solving them. For me, all of the fun is in the problem solving process, at least in my personal life.

My interests are diverse and continually changing. They include reinvisioning ideas from an AI/ML-first perspective, data science, cryptography, vanquishing non-native plants and sometimes successfully growing natives, and being a human multitool (from car and HVAC maintenance and construction to photography).

## ðŸ¦¸ My Superpowers ðŸ¦¸

- **Blitzkrieg Learning**: Understanding what I don't know and need to know at super speed.
- **Zero fear**: No hesistation...ever.
- **Asking questions no one else imagines**: I just think differently. 
- **Seeking nuance**: I'm suspicious of problems that look simple, because usually an important detail or consequence wasn't considered. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised when a solution easily falls into place.
- **Breathing life into ideas**: I'm crazy good at navigating ambiguous problems and chipping away at abstract ideas.
- **Writing for humans**: I'm obsessed with plain, approachable writing.

... with all superpowers there's a cost. You can imagine for yourself how each of those can backfire sometimes.

## I'm currently focused on

## **[ChatHoard](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/ChatHoard)** 
ChatHoard is a FOSS webapp that started as a tool to store and search my LLM chats (e.g. ChatGPT, Claude), but is rapidly growing in scope into a private, collaborative space to mine, organize, share and collaborate on LLM generated content... because I think I'm not the only one who needs a model-agnostic space to make the most of their data. It is built on [FastAPI](https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi)/[Pydantic](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic), [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)/[ChakraUI](https://github.com/chakra-ui/chakra-ui), and uses [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/)/[DocArray](https://github.com/docarray/docarray) for intelligent vector search. It's designed to be both locally deployable and also massively scalable.

## My Backburner

I have a few projects I intend to get to a stable place eventually... 

### **[AutoKeyring](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/AutoKeyring)**
-  A tool solving the problem of passwordless Linux logins
-  Securely handles unlocking Gnome/KDE keyrings and wallets without a password. ([Freedesktop.org SecretService](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/secret-service/latest/) is the underlying cryptographic management service -- it's dated... maybe some day I'll write a replacement.)
-  Automates keyring unlocking using [TPM 2.0](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/what-is-tpm-705f241d-025d-4470-80c5-4feeb24fa1ee) or [Yubikey](https://www.yubico.com/products/) as a root key generator (SecretService only accepts passwords for keyrings/wallets, so AutoKeyring derives a secure hash to use as a password or derives a secret to encrypt and store a password for unlocking operations.
-  **Status**: mid-refactor. I originally planned to use Clevis, but thought the implementation was hacky, so I'm refactoring as all-python.

### **[Amazon_Job_Alertbot](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/Amazon_Job_Alertbot)** 
- *Mostly* a tongue-in-cheeck project to gain a deep practical understanding of AWS serverless app dev/deployment.
- Self-deploying AWS serverless system of microservices that simply checks amazon.jobs and provides better search settings and an alerts agent.
- I started it out of irony because [amazon.jobs](amazon.jobs) doesn't offer a job alerts service and I thought where better to build one that AWS?
- **Status**: Basic service works. I just need to finish the search template generation UI. Had I known pydantic existed it would have went much faster...
- Maybe one day someone at Amazon will happen upon it and use some of it to implement an actual alerts service (they would only need a small portion because they have amazon.jobs already)...

### **[fedcal](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/fedcal)** 
- A [pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas) namespace extension (like .dt for Series) that adds Federal timeseries information to native pandas objects.
- The [offsets module](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/fedcal/fedcal/offsets.py) is finished and serves some quirky calendar offset capabilties (Federal holidays accounting for Presidential proclamations, military passes, civilian and military paydays, federal fiscal years/quartersfactors) that affect federal productivity, and actually adds vectorized operations where there weren't vectorized operations in pandas Offsets (another backburner is proposing those changes to pandas itself).
- There is also an [accompanying database of funding/appropriations status for all top-level federal departments since 1970](https://github.com/seekinginfiniteloop/fedcal/fedcal/status_intervals.json) (i.e. shutdowns, continuing resolutions, etc). The library aims to enable sophisticated statistical studies of the effects of federal budget and productivity processes on both government function and the unimagined consequences (i.e. impacts on local businesses, etc). I'm still thinking through how best to deliver the budget data for clean integration with pandas.  Another path is taking it back a step, using python (or numpy) objects and creating an interface so it can integrate with not just pandas but polars and other dataframe libraries.
