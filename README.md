# 🏴‍☠️ Welcome

Hey, I’m Adam aka @bashandbone — a self-taught engineer, longtime Linux user, and founder building sharp tools for complex systems.  
I believe great UX starts with understanding, and I write code that makes the hard parts plain.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

- 🧵 [`knitli`](https://knit.li) — edge-native AI meets radically human UX  
- 📜 [`plain license`](https://plainlicense.org) — creative licenses, reimagined for real people  
- 🛠️ Building serverless SaaS from scratch (Cloudflare Workers, D1, KV, Vectorize, Workers AI)  
- 🧠 Rethinking documentation, onboarding, and the meaning of useful
- 🏴‍☠️ Occasionally yelling "RTFM" (lovingly) while writing it
- ✍️ Spending too much time on [small diversions](https://github.com/knitli/mad-icons).
