# 🏴‍☠️ Welcome to @bashandbone ☠️

Hey, I’m Adam — self-taught engineer ⌨️, recovering spymaster 🕵️, expert risk-enabler 🧨, and founder 🧱 building sharp tools 🧰 for complex systems.

I believe great UX starts with understanding, and I write code that makes the hard parts plain.[^1]

[^1]: I try to, at least.

## 🧭 My Philosophy

- Clear beats clever.
- Docs are infrastructure.
- UX is the only X, and it's not just for people.
- Types are functions. 
- Plain language is a superpower, not a compromise.
- Measure twice, then embrace risk.

### 📓 Docs like spells. Code like tools. UX like rebellion.
