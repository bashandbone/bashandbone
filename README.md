## ðŸ¦¸ My Superpowers ðŸ¦¸

- **Blitzkrieg Learning**: Understanding what I don't know and need to know at super speed.
- **Zero fear**: No hesistation...ever.
- **Asking questions no one else imagines**: I just think differently. 
- **Seeking nuance**: I'm suspicious of problems that look simple, because usually an important detail or consequence wasn't considered. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised when a solution easily falls into place.
- **Breathing life into ideas**: I'm crazy good at navigating ambiguous problems and chipping away at abstract ideas.
- **Writing for humans**: I'm obsessed with plain, approachable writing.

... all superpowers have a cost. You can imagine for yourself how each of those can backfire sometimes.
