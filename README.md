# 🏴‍☠️ Welcome to @bashandbone ☠️

Hey, I’m Adam — self-taught engineer ⌨️, recovering spymaster 🕵️[^1], expert risk-enabler 🧨, and founder 🧱 [@knitli](https://github.com/knitli) building sharp tools 🧰 for complex systems.

[^1]: [Really!](https://blog.knitli.com/from-intelligence-expert-to-ai-business-leader-a-surprising-path/)

I believe great UX starts with understanding, and I write code that makes the hard parts plain.[^1]

[^1]: I try to, at least.

## 🔥 What I'm Working On

- 🧵 [`knitli`](https://knitli.com) — giving AI agents and developers the tools they deserve to empower both: [CodeWeaver](https://github.com/knitli/codeweaver) and [Thread](https://github.com/knitli/thread)
- 🛠️ Building serverless SaaS from scratch (Cloudflare Workers, D1, KV, Vectorize, Workers AI)  
- 🧠 Rethinking documentation, onboarding, and the meaning of useful
- 🏴‍☠️ Occasionally yelling "RTFM" (lovingly) while writing it
- ✍️ Reinventing old tools to solve new problems. 


### What I Want to Finish

- [PlainLicense](https://github.com/plainlicense/plainlicense) - Creative licenses reimagined for real people
  - Taking a back seat while I build Knitli, but I'm obsessed with accessible language.

## 💻 Tech I Reach For

```bash
Python  ·  TypeScript  ·  Rust  ·  Bash  ·  Pkl
Cloudflare Edge Stack  ·  Astro   ·  Vite  ·  Tree Sitter
terminal interfaces  ·  functional patterns  ·  zero-trust everything
```

## 🧭 My Philosophy

- Clear beats clever.
- Docs are infrastructure.
- UX is the only X, and it's not just for people.
- Types are functions. 
- Plain language is a superpower, not a compromise.
- Measure twice, then embrace risk.
