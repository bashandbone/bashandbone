# Welcome to my infinite loop...

I'm an avid pythonista who sometimes finds himself writing Rust, Typescript or Go. I don't work in tech and don't develop professionally, but I aim to write professional code. If my code doesn't meet profesional standards, please tell me; Since I don't work in tech, I can sometimes overlook the obvious approach. On the plus side, I occasionally stumble into novel approaches too. 

My work here is just an extension of **my obsessive need to solve interesting problems** and in the process, go way (**way**) too deep. The problem solving process is what I enjoy the most, at least in my personal life.

My interests are diverse and are always changing. They include reinvisioning ideas from an AI/ML-first perspective, data science, cryptography, vanquishing non-native plants and sometimes successfully growing natives in their place, and being a human multitool (from car and HVAC maintenance and construction to photography).

## ðŸ¦¸ My Superpowers ðŸ¦¸

- **Blitzkrieg Learning**: Understanding what I don't know and need to know at super speed.
- **Zero fear**: No hesistation...ever.
- **Asking questions no one else imagines**: I just think differently. 
- **Seeking nuance**: I'm suspicious of problems that look simple, because usually an important detail or consequence wasn't considered. Sometimes I'm pleasantly surprised when a solution easily falls into place.
- **Breathing life into ideas**: I'm crazy good at navigating ambiguous problems and chipping away at abstract ideas.
- **Writing for humans**: I'm obsessed with plain, approachable writing.

... all superpowers have a cost. You can imagine for yourself how each of those can backfire sometimes.

An initiative to rewrite popular licenses in plain language. Because innovation should be easy to understand. [Visit the site at https://plainlicense.org](https://plainlicense.org)
